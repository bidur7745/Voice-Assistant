# Voice-Assistant
I have developed simple voice assistance. This project aims to create a voice-controlled assistant
 similar to Jarvis, inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man movies.
 With this assistant, you can perform various tasks using voice commands,
 making interactions with your computer more intuitive and efficient.

Prerequisites
To use the Simple Voice Assistant, you need the following:

Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website.

PyCharm Community Edition: The project was developed using PyCharm, a popular integrated development environment for Python. You can download the Community Edition from the PyCharm website.
